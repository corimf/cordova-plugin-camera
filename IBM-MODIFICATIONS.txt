- Full description: When using the DATA_URL destination type setting in the
cordova-camera-plugin for Android, images do not get saved to the Android 
device's image gallery. To save to the image gallery, users would have to 
use other destination types instead because the functionality was not present 
for DATA_URL.

  destination is handled, in order to return an URI or a Blob URL object.
