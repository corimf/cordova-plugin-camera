RTC: 43945 - In Android 4.4 no videos in the gallery are available at all

- RTC work item number: 43945
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5398
- Markmail or Google Group reference:
- Product PMR: APAR: 42806
- Description: Revert the workaround for image picker problem with content:// URI's
and the inability to act with StorageAccessFramework. The workaround only shows image
files when using the Gallery but should also show videos. This is accomplished by
just backporting to cordova-android the fix to use StorageAccessFramework correctly. 


RTC: 31533 - Backport CB-5398 (image picker) to 3.1 ESR

Workaround image picker issue with content:// URIs

- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5398
- Markmail or Google Group reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19834842/android-gallery-on-kitkat-returns-different-uri-for-intent-action-get-content
- Product PMR: APAR: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07246
- Description: Backport CB-5398 to this branch. Without it, starting in Android
4.4.x, selecting an image with the Camera plugin API would only work when
the image was chosen from "Downloads" folder, or when the user chose an image by
going through the Gallery app, or when the image was returned as a DATA_URL.
This issue is caused by a content:// URI encoding problem with Android. The workaround
chosen forces the image picker to always go through the Gallery app instead of the 
StorageAccessFramework, which was introduced in 4.4. 


Fix geolocation for iOS 8

- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-7158 ,
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-7461
- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference:
- IBM PMR: (found before shipped)
- Worklight RTC work item number:
- Full description: Using the built-in webview navigator.geolocation requires a
new key added to the info.plist file for iOS 8. This is just added in the
plugin.xml file for geolocation and the issue is resolved. For the Cordova
Geolocation plugin, the issue requires the change above plus a change to the
CDVLocation.m file in the plugin. The iOS8 SDK changed the API for requesting
permission to access location. Therefore, changes had to be made on the
native side to account for that.
