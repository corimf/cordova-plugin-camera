- Full description: Android N introduced the FileUriExposed exception which occurs when an app 
tries to access file:/// URIs outside of the scope of its own app. This is apparent in the 
Cordova camera plugin when the device's camera app tries to pass the file URI of an image to 
the Cordova app through the camera plugin, the Cordova app will crash with this exception.
To solve this, Cordova implemented a custom URI to bypass this access restriction, so it won't 
be handling file URIs, rather a custom URI.

- Full description: The Android M permission model will request for permissions at 
run time. To add this support, Cordova plugins will need to add permission request functions 
in Android API 23 to handle the run time permissions.

Fix rotated image when using DATA_URL for Android

- Apache Cordova Jira issue: 
- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference:
- IBM PMR: 75991,082,000
- Cherry Pick: 
- Worklight RTC work item number: APAR PI53212 / RTC 94943
- Full description: Saved images using the DATA_URL option in Android
devices are always saved in landscape orientation. If taking a picture 
in portrait orientation, the saved image will be rotated by 90 degrees. 
The solution is to change the write image function to write the bitmap 
with the correct orientation instead of the uncompressed image.

device's image gallery. To save to the image gallery, users would have to 
use other destination types instead because the functionality was not present 
for DATA_URL.

Fix cropping large images for Android that causes app to close on Nexus devices

- Cordova RTC work item number: 68891
- Apache Cordova Jira issue:
- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference:
- IBM PMR: 16264,082,000
- Worklight RTC work item number: (APAR) 68228
- Full description: The problem is trying to crop with a large image. 
  The app will close with an exception of exceeding the transaction binder limit.  
  The problem only occurs on Nexus devices. The crop intent would return the whole 
  bitmap image which was too big and caused an exception for exceeding the binder 
  transaction size and thus causing the activity to close. The solution was to pass 
  in the uri to crop instead which is what is done in later versions. In 
  CameraLauncher.java, the cropping was changed to receiving the uri of the image.

Fix geolocation for iOS 8

                             https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-7461
- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference:
- IBM PMR: (found before shipped)
- Worklight RTC work item number:
- Full description: Using the built-in webview navigator.geolocation requires a
  new key added to the info.plist file for iOS 8. This is just added in the
  plugin.xml file for geolocation and the issue is resolved.  For the Cordova
  Geolocation plugin, the issue requires the change above plus a change to the
  CDVLocation.m file in the plugin. The iOS8 SDK changed the API for requesting
  permission to access location. Therefore, changes had to be made on the
  native side to account for that.
