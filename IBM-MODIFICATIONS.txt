RTC: 43945 - In Android 4.4 no videos in the gallery are available at all

- RTC work item number: 43945
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5398
- Markmail or Google Group reference:
- Product PMR: APAR: 42806
- Description: Revert the workaround for image picker problem with content:// URI's
and the inability to act with StorageAccessFramework. The workaround only shows image
files when using the Gallery but should also show videos. This is accomplished by
just backporting to cordova-android the fix to use StorageAccessFramework correctly.

- Product PMR: APAR: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07246
- Description: Backport CB-5398 to this branch. Without it, starting in Android
4.4.x, selecting an image with the Camera plugin API would only work when
the image was chosen from "Downloads" folder, or when the user chose an image by
going through the Gallery app, or when the image was returned as a DATA_URL.
This issue is caused by a content:// URI encoding problem with Android. The workaround
chosen forces the image picker to always go through the Gallery app instead of the 
StorageAccessFramework, which was introduced in 4.4.
