- Full description: Using the built-in webview navigator.geolocation requires a
new key added to the info.plist file for iOS 8. This is just added in the
plugin.xml file for geolocation and the issue is resolved. For the Cordova
Geolocation plugin, the issue requires the change above plus a change to the
CDVLocation.m file in the plugin. The iOS8 SDK changed the API for requesting
permission to access location. Therefore, changes had to be made on the
native side to account for that.

Pressing back button when selecing image causes app crash

- Full description: Pressing the back button when the image selection dialog
is active causes the application to crash on some Samsung devices. This is due
to the intent returning null on these devices. The fix was backported from 
this commit in cordova-plugin-camera: 5b8324e9 and a small subset of d899d7a4.
This was discovered in Cordova 3.1.0esr so we are fixing this subsequent 
version as well. Cordova 3.6.0esr will be fine since the plugin version has 
been updated in that stream.
