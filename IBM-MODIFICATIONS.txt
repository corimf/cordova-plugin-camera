Fix cropping large images for Android that causes app to close on Nexus devices

- Cordova RTC work item number: 68891
- Apache Cordova Jira issue:
- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference:
- IBM PMR: 16264,082,000
- Worklight RTC work item number: (APAR) 68228
- Full description: The problem is trying to crop with a large image. 
  The app will close with an exception of exceeding the transaction binder limit.  
  The problem only occurs on Nexus devices. The crop intent would return the whole 
  bitmap image which was too big and caused an exception for exceeding the binder 
  transaction size and thus causing the activity to close. The solution was to pass 
  in the uri to crop instead which is what is done in later versions. In 
  CameraLauncher.java, the cropping was changed to receiving the uri of the image.

Fix geolocation for iOS 8

- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-7158 ,
                             https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-7461
- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference:
- IBM PMR: (found before shipped)
- Worklight RTC work item number:
- Full description: Using the built-in webview navigator.geolocation requires a
  new key added to the info.plist file for iOS 8. This is just added in the
  plugin.xml file for geolocation and the issue is resolved.  For the Cordova
  Geolocation plugin, the issue requires the change above plus a change to the
  CDVLocation.m file in the plugin. The iOS8 SDK changed the API for requesting
  permission to access location. Therefore, changes had to be made on the
  native side to account for that.
